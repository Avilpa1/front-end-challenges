# Lesson 3: DOM Traversal, DOM manipulation, and Javascript Interactivity

Now that we have a basic page with external styles, we can add interactivity. This is where Javascript comes into play.

### Requirements

- Review DOM: Understanding Concepts.
- Traverse the DOM to find a `<a>` element.
- Use that element: add a `title` attribute.
- Find an array of list elements from the `<ul>`.
- Add a class to the second list element using javascript.
- Add a button that `onClick` will call a show/hide toggle function.
- From that function using JS, add a style attribute of display `block`/`none` to toggle on and off when the function is runs.
- Add an `onload` property to the page with an `alert` function that displays the text: "Thank you for viewing my resume! "
- **EXTRA:** Add an additional button with an `onClick` function that will add a class "clicked" to the parent DOM elment (`section` or `aside` depending on where the button is). From within the CSS for the "clicked" selector, add a property that will give it a `background-color` of red. 

### Key Concepts

- The Document Object Model, or DOM, is your browser's interpretation of the HTML it reads. When JavaScript changes the page, it updates the DOM, not the HTML.
