# Lesson 1: HTML, Inline and Block Elements

In this challenge, we're going to be adding basic HTML elements and styling them. Start with the index.html file and add the tags within the `<body></body>` tag.

### Requirements

- Edit the `<title></title>` metatag in the header.
- Use the following block element tags correctly on the page within the body in this order: `<h1>`, `<p>`, `<ul>` with 3 list items, `<h2>`, `<p>`, `<ol>` with 3 list items, `<p>`, `<div>`. 
- Use the following inline element tags correctly anywhere on the page: `<a>`, `<br>`, `<em>`, `<span>`, `<small>`, `<img>`.
- An example image can pulled from the `/img/` directory, or if you'd like to add your own then download it and add to the `/img/` directory.

#### Terminology

- Block elements: HTML elements that create a "block" in the display by appearing on their own line.
- Tags: HTML annotations which indicate how the text should be formatted.
- P tag: An HTML tag that indicates text should be formatted in a paragraph.
- Opening tag: An HTML tag that appears before the text that will be formatted in an HTML document. For example, the `<p> in <p> This is a paragraph. </p>` is the opening tag.
- Closing tag: An HTML tag that appears after the text that is formatted. It matches the opening tag but begins with a /. For example, the `</p>` in `<p> This is a paragraph. </p>` is the closing tag.
- End tag: An alternative name for a closing tag.
- Header: An HTML tag to indicate the text being formatted is a header. There are 6 sizes of HTML headers `<h1> through <h6>`.

- Inline element: HTML elements that do not appear on their own line, but instead share a line with other elements.
- Attribute: Additional information provided to an HTML tag. For instance, the href attribute in an `<a>` tag provides the URL a link should travel to.
